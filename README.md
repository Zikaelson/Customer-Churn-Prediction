**INTRODUCTION**

Due to the high cost of acquiring new customers, customer churn prediction has emerged as an indispensable part of telecom sectors’ strategic decision making and planning process. It is important to forecast customer churn behavior to retain those customers that will churn or possible may churn.
The cost of saving current customers is lesser than attractive other company customers or free customers to use of telecom company services, so it is important to predict the group of customers that are in-danger and persuade them to stay.

Acquiring new customers always costs heavily and this makes the predictive churn model appealing for businesses that aim at retaining customers and maximizing profits. Although predicting customer churn seems to be easy initially it involves several challenges. 

In summary, the business problem here is to predict behavior to retain customers by analysing all relevant customer data i.e., create a model that can predict customers that will churn in the telecom industry

Some of the challenges faced by Data Scientist and Machine learning engineers in building a model using python are:
1. Lack of a ‘silver bullet’ methodology
2. Features and exploratory analysis
3. Validating churn model performance
